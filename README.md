### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a full-time full-stack dev at woodbrass.com.

I'm currently working on making my personal blog as a learning experience. I plan on using a bunch of tech, mainly typescript for the frontend and rust for the backend.

I recently fell in love with anything strongly typed. As someone who for a long time worked with php and vanilla js I absolutely love the safety and capabilities a good typed language allows.

You can reach out to me by sending me an email at joulin.nicolas@gmail.com or by sending me a message on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-joulin-8b5a92166/).
